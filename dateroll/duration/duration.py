    we do not inherit from relativedelta or timedelta, it is something to be considered

    Duration class represents a period of time, a duration of time, an interval of time
    i.e. some distance of time between two specific (yet unknown) dates

    there's implicitly 2 modes:

    calendar day mode - no knowledge of holidays or non-working days
        When counting days, there is no skipping over some days over others because a governing body declares that the offices are closed.

    business day mode -
        a) implicit assumption that 'WE' is always used in bd calcs
            'WE' stands for [W]eek[End] which is our internal two-letter code for the holiday of Saturdays and Sunday's during the "reasonable business period"
        b) user supplied holiday vectors can be unioned for adjusting accordingly

        bd adjustment is O(1) assuming the calenders are in memory or the unions are cached, worst
        bd adjustment is O(n) on bd's between two dates.

    A duration can have a number of:
        business days
        days (1d = 1.44bd)
        weeks  (1w=7d)
        months (1m approx 28-31d)
        years (1y=12m)

    ^ in order of seniority


    We define the "reasonable business period" (naiively) as the interval of (t-100y,t+100y)
        this could be extended: from 1582 AD to future if we have historical vectors for holiday calendar changes (i.e. juneteenth 1st occured on X, to map backwards math, and assume last forward for futuree math (e.g. last jubilee was 5cd, and happens every 50years..))
        realistically 5-7 year perfect lookup would be more than substantial for more use cases.
