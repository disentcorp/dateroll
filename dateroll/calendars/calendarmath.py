    CalendarMath is a singleton that holds "compiled" version of your Calendars
    Calendar is a dict-on-disk object that stores vectors of all holidays.
    CalendarMath stores calendar unions (cached), bd-counter dictionaries for your calendars, and more, and has a cached-on-disk backend as well.
    If a mutation of a calendar is detected, cached is purged and CalendarMath triggers a rebuild.

    CalendarMath operationsa are used by Duration and Date:

    add_bd(d,n,cals)    - add n bd's do to d on cals
    sub_bd(d,n,cals)    - sub n bd's to d on cals
    is_bd(d,cals)       - is d a bd on cals
    diff(d1,d2,cals,ie=IE_RULE) - how many bd's between d1 and d2 on cals and using inclusion/exclusion rules (] [) () or []
    next_bd(d1,cals)    - next business day (mod=True triggers modified following)
    prev_bd(d1,cals)    - previous business day (mod=True triggered modified previous)

    calenedar unions are handled automatically and cached, if a list of calendars is provided a new set of compiled calendars is created (doesn't impact Calendar's dict-on-disk representation
